# Hey there!

## I'm Jack, a computer science student and wannabe software engineer. 👨‍💻

I'm in my fourth year at MacEwan University as a computer science major, currently seeking software engineering internships while I bulk out this portfolio and continue learning. I obsess over details and believe in minimalist results achieved through maximum effort. *Nicely done.*

Check out [my personal site](https://jackderksen.github.io/) to learn a little more about me, and see what I'm currently learning and working on! Also feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jack-derksen-6292a1261).
