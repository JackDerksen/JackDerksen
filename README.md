## Hey there!
### I'm Jack, a computer science student and wannabe software engineer. 👨🏼‍💻

I'm currently in my fourth year at MacEwan University as a computer science major. I'm currently seeking software engineering internships while I bulk out this portfolio and continue learning.
I obsess over details and believe in minimalist results achieved through maximum effort. **Nicely done.**
