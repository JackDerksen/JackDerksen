## Hey there! I'm Jack, a computer science student and aspiring software engineer

### About Me
I'm in my final undergraduate year at MacEwan University as a computer science student, currently building out my portfolio and expanding my knowledge. I obsess over details and believe in minimalist results achieved through maximum effort.
